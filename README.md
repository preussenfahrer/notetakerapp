 ## Description: 
 Notetakerapp fills one of the most important gaps for not just a developer, but for anyone who has to write, save, and delete notes as part of their daily routine. Through using `node js`, `JavaScript`, and employing a live server, the user can successfully write, store, and delete their daily notes for a variety of purposes.
    
 ## Installation:      
  Notetakerapp runs on `node js`, and requires `express`. Make sure that these are correctly installed in the terminal by running `npm i`.

 ## Testing:
 To checkout the functionality of the application, here is a series of five images that show how one goes to the note pages, makes a note, saves the note, and then deletes said note. You can also see the functionality of this in the demo video.
